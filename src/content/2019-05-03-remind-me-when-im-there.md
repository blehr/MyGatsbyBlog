## Why Can't I Remember?

Remembering things is hard. Reminding others to remember stuff is even harder.

I know you have tried all of the reminder apps, that you never remember to check. And that you have tried scheduling reminders to notify you when you think you will need it.

### So what's the problem?

Often reminders aren't needed when <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>, they are needed where <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>.

<i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> When I get to the office, I have to...

<i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Next time I'm at the grocery store I need to get...

<i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Why can't my husband remember to shut the garage door when he leaves...

<i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> When Carl gets to the client's office I need him to remember to sign in...

What do all these have in common? They need reminded at a **location**, not a time!

## Location Aware Reminders
